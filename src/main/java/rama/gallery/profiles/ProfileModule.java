/*
 * This module demonstrates account registration, generating unique 64-bit user IDs, and editing profiles.
 * The implementation is fault-tolerant, and there are no race conditions.
 *
 * See the test class ProfileModuleTest for how a client interacts with this module to perform user registrations
 * and profile edits.
 *
 * You can see the data types used by the module in the package rama.gallery.profiles.data.
 *
 * As with all the demos, data is represented as plain Java objects with public fields. You can represent
 * data however you want, and we generally recommend using a library with compact serialization and support
 * for evolving types (like Thrift or Protocol Buffers). We use plain Java objects in these demos to keep
 * them as simple as possible by not having additional dependencies. Using other representations is easy to do
 * by defining a custom serialization, and in all cases you always work with first-class objects all the time
 * when using Rama, whether appending to depots, processing in ETLs, or querying from PStates.
